# 🚀 Daily DSA Practice in C++

Welcome to my **Daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
I’m on a mission to strengthen my problem-solving skills by consistently solving DSA problems using **C++**.
---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository is created to:
- Sharpen my DSA skills in a structured and consistent way.
- Track my daily progress.
- Serve as a reference for commonly asked coding problems.
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding competitions.
---

## 📅 Daily Progress

I aim to solve at least **1-3 problems every day**, covering various topics in DSA.  
Each problem is solved with a focus on:
- Optimal Time and Space Complexity.
- Proper use of STL and C++ best practices.
- Readable and well-commented code.

Each folder contains:
- Problem statement (if needed)
- Code file (`.cpp`)
- Comments explaining logic and approach
